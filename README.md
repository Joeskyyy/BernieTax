#Just How Much Will Bernie Tax Me?
This project compiles all of the proposed tax plans from Democratic 
Presidential Candidate Senator Bernie Sanders to determine the effective tax
rates for individuals at different outcomes in comparison with current tax laws.

The current settings are for a family of 4 living in a state that took the 
Obamacare medicaid expansion. The following items are included in the 
calculations:

* Federal Income Tax
* Social Security Tax
* Medicare Tax
* Medicare-for-all Tax 
* Paid Family Leave Tax
* Average healthcare premium costs
* Average healthcare out of pocket costs
* Obamacare Premium Tax Credits
* Employer contributions to Social Security and Medicare
* Employer contributions to healthcare

(Note: employer contributions are considered part of compensation and added to the income to create an "effective income" for rate calculations)

The impact of the following [proposals from Bernie Sanders](https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-bernie-pays-for-his-proposals/) is included:

* Rebuild America Act
* College for All
* Expand and Extend Social Security
* Youth Jobs Program
